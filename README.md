# RGBColorGuessingGame

Guess the correct color based on the RGB value given.

Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

When you load the page, 6 different, random colors are shown. Choose the correct color based on the RGB value listed at the top of the page. 
There are 2 levels: "Easy" with 3 colors to choose from & "Hard" with 6 colors to choose from.

The page alters itself accordingly if the correct or incorrect color is chosen. If the incorrect color is chosen, the box disappears and the "Try Again" message appears. When the correct color is chosen, all the boxes correspond with that color.
